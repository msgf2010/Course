//Create an application to track potential student/candidates for an upcoming course.

//On the home page, display 4 links: Add Candidate, View Pending, View Confirmed
//and View Declined.

//When the user clicks on the Add Candidate link, they should be taken to a page
//that has a form where they can add the name, phone number and email of the
//candidate. They should also be able to add notes (e.g. some details about the
//conversation with the candidate to help remember them in the future)

//When they click on View Pending, they should be taken to a page that displays
//a list of all the pending candidates. Next to each one, display a link
//that allows the user to see that individual candidate. When they click on that link,
//they should be taken to a page that displays all the information (including the
//notes) of that candidate along with two buttons: Confirm and Decline. When either
//one of those buttons are clicked, via ajax, update the status of that candidate.

//The View Confirmed and View Declined links should take the user to a page that
//shows the confirmed/declined candidates. For extra JS practice, add a "Toggle Notes"
//button, that when clicked, shows/hides the notes column in the table.

//Finally, in the navbar of the application, there should be three links: Pending,
//Confirmed and Declined. Next to each one of those links, display a number indicating
//how many there are of each bunch. These numbers should also be updated when
//confirming/declining via Ajax.
